            Hi there! I'm <b>FAVOUR GILIAN</b>,<br> 
            A first-year <i>Computer Science student</i> with a deep passion for technology and coding. <br>
            I am currently studying at <b>WOMEN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION</b>, <br>
            Where I am honing my skills in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving. <br> 
            I'm excited to learn new languages, frameworks, and tools. <br>
            <br> I am constantly exploring new ways to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. <br>
            I believe that technology is one of the most powerful forces for change in the world.  <br>
            From building solutions that improve lives to solving problems that haven't been tackled before, <br> 
            the ability to create something out of nothing is what excites me the most. <br>
            What motivates me each day is the challenge of learning new concepts, overcoming obstacles, and constantly improving my skills. <br>
            I thrive on the process of growth and am always looking for ways to make a real impact through technology. <br>
